# SimpleVector
Container, a simplified analogue of std::vector. A pointer wrapper has been written for this container. The RAII idiom is used.
# Building and Run
GCC is used for the assembly:
  1. g++ main.cpp -Wall -Werror -std=c++17 -o simple_vector
  2. Start ./simple_vector or simple_vector.exe
# System requirements and Stack
  1. C++17
  2. GCC version 8.1.0
  3. RAII
# Future Plans
  1. Add a script to build the project
